# Data Structures and Algorithms
Here you'll find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in Java language Swift, with brief explanations of how they work.

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- this repository will definitely help!
