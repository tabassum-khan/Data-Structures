# Binary Search Tree

## Introduction

- A Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

- A representation of binary tree is shown:

## Design and Implementation

A full implementation of the binary tree is given [here](https://github.com/tabassum-khan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/trees/BinarySearchTree.java)
